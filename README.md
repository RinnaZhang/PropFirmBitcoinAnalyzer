This project scrapes prop trading firm information from Forex Prop Reviews and fetches real-time Bitcoin exchange rates using the Blockchain.com API.

The goal of this dataset is to provide users with a personalized list of prop trading firms, highlighting their pros and cons based on individual preferences and needs. Additionally, the inclusion of real-time cryptocurrency exchange rates is a valuable feature, especially for users like myself, as many prop firms pay through Web3 platforms, making it essential to track Bitcoin rates.
